	 <p> Hello everyone! I am Pamela Navarro. 
I am 19 years old and I live in Barra 
Opol, Misamis Oriental. I am the eldest in 
the family, and my hobbies when I have 
free time are reading, watching movies, 
and sleeping. I don't know if sleeping is 
included in what so-called hobbies are, 
but let's include it. My dream is to learn 
as many instruments as possible. It's
fascinating to me that instruments convey 
a lot of emotions and ideas, so if given a 
chance, why not?. As I grew older, I dreamed of 
visiting many different places and trying things that
I hadn't done before. Back then, I used to fantasize about 
living in Paris and getting my life together. Once I'm 
financially free, I would like to fulfill my childhood dream. </p>

      <p2> My teenage years were like a roller coaster 
	  experience. As a normal teen, I sometimes break the rules to feel 
	  what it is like to have fun outside of your parents' guidance. However, 
	  as I grew older and felt like I was about to quit my teenage life, 
	  somehow I realized that I enjoyed it, and that will forever be 
	  engraved in my heart. </p2>
